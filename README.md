# Portfolio-Project for Covid Data

##Intro##

The data is sourced from ourworldindata.org and includes confirmed deaths and vaccinations from all over the world. The data is only up to April of 2023. 
The main goal is to find out the total confirmed deaths and vaccinations of covid-19, and to break that information down by continents, country, and the percentage of population infected. 
The sql code originally had tables created at the end for easy visualization creation through tableau but I did not realize tableau public does not allow sql to tableau imports so old fashioned
cut and paste of the data was used instead. 

##Global Numbers##

Total confirmed cases was 764 million, with confirmed deaths at almost 7 million. This makes the percentage of deaths .91, but still a staggering amount. And this is only CONFIRMED cases so most likely
higher than what was reported. 

##By Contient##

The highest confirmed deaths by continent turns out to be Europe, which is a bit surprising to me since I assumed Asia, the largest continent would have the most problems with covid.
This could be because the response places like China was much more urgent and strict compared to Europe. France, Italy, Germany, and Australia all had 50% or almost 50% infection rate by population. Incredibly high even 
if the population count itself is not as high as places like China or U.S. China on the other hand had an amazinginly low amount of confirmed infections, not even breaking 100,000 in number despite the population being one of 
the largest. 

##Vaccination##

As far as vaccinations were concerned, it seemes like China leads the total vaccination numbers, which would explain why their confirmed cases were so low, followed by India, United States, and Russia. 

##Closing thoughts##

It seems like a variety of things caused the outcomes we have today, as you would expect. The responses to the outbreak and how quick and strict it was seems to be one of the biggest factors to having a low case count, possibly along with 
having access to the vaccines early. Some countries did not have access to the vaccine as quickly as others did. Other than that, how the citizens of each country acted during this time should also be a factor. Some countries citizens were
completely cooperative while others banned against some of the rules and regulations. This was a horrible outbreak and let us hope that nothing similar will happen again.
